[CHV] Message number 1 in line 1:2:
An HTML5 DOCTYPE was found. HTML5 (sometimes called just
HTML) is in a constant state of flux. While many parts of
HTML5 are considered stable and safe to use, there are parts
that are not stable or that may not be well supported by
browsers. When using HTML5, be sure to understand the
potential problems when using parts and features that may
not be stable (and thus may change in the future) or that
may not be widely supported. Visit

[CHV] Message number 2 in line 6:3:
Tip - A good title is important for search engine listings
and can appear in search results pages. Try to use keywords
and search terms in the title but keep it readable and not
too long. Don't just stuff keywords in the title. The first
words in the title are more likely to result in higher
rankings than subsequent words, so use important keywords at
the very beginning when reasonable. The title should also be
something that a user will want to click on when it's listed
on a search results page. A good title is also important
when a visitor bookmarks a page. Example: <title>Download
CSS HTML Validator - Powerful HTML and Link Checking
Software for Windows</title>. We recommend that the "title"
tag be one of the first tags inside the "head" section (but
after any meta charset or viewport tags).

[CHV] Warning number 1 in line 7:14:
It is recommended that this viewport meta tag be moved up.
The viewport meta tag should be one of the first tags after
the "head" section start tag. Only the meta charset tag (if
used) and the X-UA-Compatible meta tag (if used) should come
before a viewport meta tag. This tag should also be before
the title element.

[7] Ensure that the "img" element is rarely, if ever, used

For example, do not use "img" elements to display
transparent images which rarely convey meaning and rarely
add anything useful to the document. This message is

The "em" element (for emphasized text) or the "cite" element
(for citations) or the "dfn" element (for the defining
instance of a term) may be more appropriate than the "i"
element. The "i" element is often used when the "em" element
would be more appropriate. Use the "i" element for text in

[CHV] Comment number 2:
WCAG 2.0/2.1 accessibility checking is off.

[CHV] Comment number 3:
Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible website makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.

Editing Tip: This document was specified as utf-8 encoded.
Editing documents with the wrong encoding may cause document
corruption. Ensure that any editor used to edit a document
properly supports the document's encoding and properly loads
it with the correct encoding. CSS HTML Validator's editor
supports UTF-8 and other common encodings.

[CHV] Comment number 7:
Use CSS class names that describe the nature of the content
instead of names that describe the presentation of the
content. For example, don't use class="red" or class="bold",
instead use something like class="important".

[CHV] Comment number 8:
This document's title is 28 characters long. Consider adding
a <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="(13
character short title)"> tag to the head section. This
shorter title will be used when an iOS user adds the page to
their Home Screen, otherwise the page title will be used and
will be chopped off after the 13th character. The title is:
"Products | Bagel's BBQ Sauce".

[133] Mobility Tip #10 - Avoid fixed widths and absolute
units (like "px") in favor of relative widths (like percents
and "em") wherever possible.

[CHV] Comment number 10:
<meta name="description" content="(actual description)">
should be used in the "head" section to provide a brief
description (preferably within 200-300 characters) of what
is contained on this page. Although descriptions may not be
used directly for rankings, search engines may display
descriptions in search results, with bolding of the relevent
keywords. Therefore, a good description can help boost
click-through rates and thus increase traffic to a website.
If you're using HTML Validator's integrated editor, then
this can be added from the 'Tags' menu or from the HTML
Inserter.

[CHV] Comment number 11:
Number of "a" links: 7, of which 0 (0.0%) have
rel="nofollow". Use rel="nofollow" to tell search engines
not to follow the link and tell Google not to transfer
PageRank or anchor text across the link. Use rel="nofollow"
for untrusted content, paid links, and crawl prioritization.

[113] Random Search Engine Tip #21 - BEWARE OF FLASH. Be
aware that using Flash causes issues for search engine
spiders because they are unlikely to be able to see and
index the text content in a Flash object. Use alternate ways
of making Flash content available to search engines, such as
including links to alternate pages that do not use Flash
objects. This will also be helpful for visitors who are
unable to view Flash content.
